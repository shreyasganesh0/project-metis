Project Metis is a miniature, production-grade Internal Developer Platform (IDP) built to provide a massively simplified, opinionated "paved road" for application developers. It automates the complexity of building, deploying, and operating services at scale.

## The Problem
In a large engineering organization, managing the lifecycle of hundreds of microservices is complex. Developers face significant cognitive overhead dealing with raw Kubernetes YAML, CI/CD pipelines, observability tooling, and security policies. Metis solves this by providing a single, cohesive CLI and platform that automates best practices, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic.

## Core Features ‚ú®
*(This section will be updated as major features are completed)*
* **Declarative Service Management:** Define an entire service in a simple `metis.yaml` file.
* **One-Command Deployments:** Deploy to Kubernetes with a simple `metisctl deploy`.
* **Dynamic Configuration:** Manage application configuration via files and environment variables.
* **Build-Time Versioning:** Automatically embed Git commit and build data into every binary for full traceability.
* **Graceful Shutdown & Signal Handling:** Professional, production-ready application lifecycle management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Go (version 1.21+)
* Docker
* `kind`
* `kubectl`

### Build & Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shreyasganesh0/project-metis.git](https://github.com/shreyasganesh0/project-metis.git)
    cd project-metis
    ```
2.  **Build the `metisctl` binary:**
    ```bash
    make build
    ```
3.  **Run a command:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/metisctl --help
    ```

## Project Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
This project is being developed over a nine-month period to build a complete, end-to-end developer platform.

* ‚úÖ **Months 1-2: The "Paved Road"**: Declarative Deployment (`metisctl`, Kubernetes Object Generation)
* ‚¨ú **Months 3-4: The "Nervous System"**: Centralized Observability (OpenTelemetry)
* ‚¨ú **Months 5-6: The "Immune System"**: Proactive Reliability (Chaos Engineering)
* ‚¨ú **Months 7-8: The "Secure Supply Chain"**: Policy as Code (OPA/Gatekeeper)
* ‚¨ú **Month 9: The "Distinguished Engineer Pitch"**: Integration & Evangelism

## Technology Stack
* **Language:** Go
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
* **CLI Framework:** Cobra & Viper
* **API Libraries:** `client-go`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`
